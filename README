Rock-O-Meter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I looked around on Github, and the Gangplank Suck-O-Meter (sorry, "Sentiment Meter") from
Extreme Pitch wasn't open source, so I made a clone of it.

The Rock-O-Meter is available under the MIT License.

To run your own Rock-O-Meter:

    1. Buy a phone number from Twilio and create a new App. Set the SMS URL to
       http://hostname/_twilio/sms

    2. Edit the config template to your liking and save it as `config.py`

    3. Install Flask by running `pip install flask`

    4. Run the Rock-O-Meter. I serve it with Gunicorn but you can use whatever server you
       want.

    5. Open your installation fullscreen on a TV, projector, or something else. Let the
       voting begin!

Your users can text SUCK or ROCK to your Twilio number, just like the original. Anyone on 
your list of admins can text RESET to your number to set the meter back to 50.
